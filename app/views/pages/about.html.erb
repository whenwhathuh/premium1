Established in 1995 in Newark, Delaware, we are a custom cabinetry and millwork shop. We are members of CMA (Cabinet makers Association). Some of our project lists include: kitchens, offices, libraries, reception desks, vanities, all types of furniture, fireplace surrounds, home theaters, windows, doors and wine cellars, and much more. We are capable of making, matching, repairing, or creating any woodworking project from the finest of antiques to custom chicken coops. Recently we built the windows for the Hobbitt House project, winning the 2007 Paladio Special Award. This window also was featured on the back cover of Fine Homebuilding magazine.
